(1) Binary-Heap-Implementation

Binary Heap Operations
The basic operations we will implement for our binary heap are as follows:

BinaryHeap() creates a new, empty, binary heap.
insert(k) adds a new item to the heap.
findMin() returns the item with the minimum key value, leaving item in the heap.
delMin() returns the item with the minimum key value, removing the item from the heap.
isEmpty() returns true if the heap is empty, false otherwise.
size() returns the number of items in the heap.
buildHeap(list) builds a new heap from a list of keys.

(2) Implement a binary tree with list
A representation of a Tree using a list of lists.

(3) Implement a binary tree with object-oriented programming
An implementation of a Tree as a class with nodes and references.
